    "Nearly all of the shared four-digit SIC codes from the OSHA and SEC lists shared a similar description, on the basis of a direct match or an indirect (30% or more of words in common, excluding coordinating-conjunctions) match. Of mismatches, most can be attributed to punctuation, grammar or syntax (i.e., as opposed to reference to an entirely different industry)."
